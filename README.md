**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

 I can utilize industry standard methods and best practices to ensure I create secure and functional programs. I can also utilize appropriate testing techniques and code security tools to verify my code can't be manipulated or altered by unauthorized sources. It is also important to stay current on the latest software security trends and keep my development tools patched and updated. In the case of my submitted code, I used JUnit testing to ensure 100% coverage over the code's functionality.  
  
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I interpreted the user's needs by performing a static review of the supplied software requirements documentation. I also kept these requirements in mind while coding the program to ensure that it produces the needed results for the user. 
 
**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach designing software with the intentions on delivering the highest quality code I am capable of. I'm always looking for better and more efficient ways to accomplish tasks through coding. This way, I gain valuable experience with every program and code module I work on. Building understanding and experience to produce a quality program is a good way to summarize my approach.
